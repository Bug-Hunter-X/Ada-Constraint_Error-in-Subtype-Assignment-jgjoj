# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: the `Constraint_Error` exception.

The `bug.ada` file contains a simple Ada program that attempts to assign a value to a variable that falls outside the range of its defined subtype.  This results in a `Constraint_Error`.  The solution shows how to prevent this.

This example is useful for understanding subtype constraints and how to handle potential exceptions during runtime.
